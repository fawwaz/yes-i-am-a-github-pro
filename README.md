# FAQ

A: Dude. Don't you remember that I can't even afford subscription fee for GitHub Pro plan? Why would I invest my money and time for the Chrome Developer account and maintaining this shit plugin.

Q: Will I get exclusive GitHub Pro features ?  
A: Despite the badge hanging on your GitHub Profile, it doesn't mean that you will receive the benefit of an actual GitHub Pro account. It only does as it says, put a pro badge on your GitHub Profile.

Q: If I install this plugin, will I get theb 'GitHub Pro' label in [@sonnylazuardi](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi)'s "[github pro checker](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/are-you-github-pro)"?
A: No, Absolutely no. Please work harder, ask your lead to promote you so you get more money and be able to subscribe to GitHub Pro membership.
